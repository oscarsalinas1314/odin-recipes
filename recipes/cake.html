        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a delicious red velvet cake recipe that was taught to me by my grandmother. Made with a light and buttery frosting instead of the usual cream cheese. It's a little time consuming but totally worth the effort!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup shortening</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter flavored extract</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1/2 ounce red food coloring</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shortening</li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons butter flavored extraxt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 10 inch round pans</li>
            <li>Cream 1/2 cup of shortening, 1 1/2 cups of white sugar, eggs, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of butter flavored extract in a large bowl. Make a paste of cocoa and food coloring in a small bowl and add to shortening mixture. Pour in 2 1/2 cups flours alternately with the buttermilk, mixing until just incorporated. Mix 1 teaspoon of salt, baking soda, and vinegar in a small bowl, and while fizzing fold into the batter; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour the batter into prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
